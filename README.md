# Arduino Memory Game

## Description

The following Embedded System Project is inspired from the [Simon Memory Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)). The System outputs a sequence of digits (0-9) inclusive one at a time, which user has to imitate from starting by tapping the keys on the keypad until the user tap the wrong key at some point. Points are recorded after each right answer and green led glows, total score is shown after tapping the wrong key with buzzer being active for approx 1 second.

## Technologies Used

[Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard) was used to design the circuit, and then simulate thereof. This platform has wide array of useful modules and components that one may need to build basic Embedded system project especially using Arduino. And hence this is the best place to debug your code and check your circuit design before implementing it by physical means which may involve harm to certain electronic components.

Two Arduino boards have been used in this project. Main Arduino board handles the services of keypad and 7 segment display along with that it also manages the
